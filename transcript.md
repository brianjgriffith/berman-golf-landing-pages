All right. All right. All right. Mic check. One, two. Mic check. One, two. Here we go, baby.
It's game time. I hope everybody is excited. This is going to be a fun one today.
No.
Martin, you're in my screen right now. Give me a thumbs up. You can hear me. Nice. Here we go. Daniel, you're good. Stuart, Mike,
what's happening everybody? This is going to be a fun one. We got a nice turnout here. We had a great sign up for this one. Who was on the last call last month? Nobody. Good. That is great. That's really exciting. Now I don't have to worry about re repeating myself. This is going to be fun. A lot of this is going to be new. I'm really excited for this one today. I worked all Christmas break while I was supposed to not be working on this stuff. So, I'm really excited to bring this one to you. And I'm going to give you a little teaser. I can't even wait till the end to say what it's going to be. But what we're going to do is we're going to gain 10 yards in the next 30 days. And by the end of this, you're going to know how we're going to do it. I hope you are up for the challenge. Very cool. All right. All right. All right. I'm still trying to admit these things there. Here we are six years later and I'm still not a Zoom expert. I wonder if anybody knows how I don't have to make people sit in a waiting room. How can we just join? Anyways, neither here nor there. Let's do this. Share. Share. Let's Martin, you're still on my screen. Give me a thumbs up. Can you see my screen? Burman golf gain 10 yards. Awesome. I'm going to go ahead and There we go. Stuart, now you're in my screen. You can hear me and see my screen, right? Thumbs up. Stuart, are you frozen?
Yeah, I'm putting my thumb up. You can't Can you see me?
No, I can only see your face.
Wait a minute.
Did that help?
Oh, yep. Perfect. Love it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Yeah, I'm really excited about this. I worked really hard on this one and I think that you guys are going to love this. We're going to do a little challenge here. It's going to be a group effort and we're going to try to attempt to gain 10 more yards off the tea, 10 yards with a big dog in the next 30 days. So, a senior's guide to gaining Mobility and power. A senior's guide to gaining mobility and power. So, I hope that we are all ready to do this. Let's get into this thing right out of the gate. Oh, come on. Let's go. Here we go. So, here is what we're going to start with is most of you on this call right now resonated with one of my marketing messages because the primary marketing message that I'm sending out is uh seniors, you're going to lose distance. because you're getting old. It's a normal part of aging. You need to swing faster to gain more distance. This is one of my personal pet peeves here. One of the things that I hate the most is when somebody tells a 75year-old senior golfer that the only way he's going to gain distance is if he swings the damn club as fast as he possibly can. You know, the speed stick. Who's guilty of having a speed stick on here? Raise your hand if you got a speed stick. I know at least 50% of you got that. thing. Swing this weighted stick as fast as you can so we can gain swing speed. Lighter clubs. Exio, you know, I really thought that Exio had something there for a little bit because they've got the lightest club on the market. This the problem is it defies the laws of physics and we'll talk a little bit more about this here in a little bit that when you swing slower and you swing a lighter club, those two things by the laws of physics mean that you're not going to have a bigger output. Yes, there are some people that get better results swinging the exos. That's primarily because you were swinging way too heavy a club to begin with. Bigger shoulder turn equals more distance. So, these are all things that you've been told. If you could just get a bigger shoulder turn, you'd be able to get more distance. Bigger shoulder turn, the club head's going to go back further, and that's going to give you more chance to swing the damn thing. threw the golf ball and finish the golf swing and the ball's just going to keep going. Or the worst one, the worst one for the male ego, just move up tease. Now, at some point, do it because the point of the game is to have fun, right? If you can't have fun, what the hell's the point? I don't play from the tips personally. I don't play from the tips. There's nothing fun about it. Could I play from the tips? Sure. Sure, but it's not fun. Why? Why play the game if it's not fun? So, these are all things that you've been told. Come on, baby. Let's do this. There we go. Now, here's reasons why it's not true. 99% of golf instruction is geared towards a 25-year-old strong and flexible body that is athletically capable of flawless tech. technique. Now, I know that was a lot of words. Let's break this down because it's so important. 99% of golf instruction is geared towards the guys playing on Sundays. There's a simple way to say it. They're mid20s. They can move great and they're athletically superior than the rest of us. That's why they're pros. Now, pay attention to this everybody. This is really important. I know this is going to resonate with at least one person on this call. So, I got to say this. Just because it's golf doesn't mean we should be able to do what they do. It's the same exact thing as I watch Michael Jordan or LeBron James driving down the basketball court and doing some crazy athletic move to dunk the ball and saying, "Well, I play basketball. I should be able to do that, too." No, you shouldn't. Just because you see Sheffller dancing his feet all over like a wild man, like he's on the dance floor doesn't mean we should do it. He's the best golfer in the world. So 99% of golf instruction is geared towards a 25-year-old body that's strong and flexible that's athletically capable of flawless technique, aka the pros that you see playing on TV on Sundays. Now, here's where it's going to start to get fun. Technique versus biomechanics. Technique versus biomechan mechanics. So, part of the research that I was doing was I was fact-checking a bunch of the um rumors, if you will, just factchecking to see what is the real statistics of amateur golfers. And the reality is that at least 75% of amateur golfers cannot consistently break 100 following the rules set by the PGA of America. What does that mean? Okay. Well, there's no mulligan on the front nine. There's no mulligan on the back nine. There's no breakfast ball off the first TE. There's no hand wedge. There's no foot wedge. There's no gimme. That putts close enough. There's no gimmies. So, if we amateur golfers followed the rules the way that the pros do on TV, 75% of us would never break a 100. I'm including myself in that right now for the purposes of this. What's even more eye eye openening is that 20% of amateur golfers only 20 can consistently break 90. Now, here's the reason why that's important. Technique versus biomechanics. When your technique is optimal, your score goes down. When your technique is flawless, you can get away with the biomechanics not being optimal. Let me explain a little bit more here. Last year alone, There were 25 million golf lessons taken in 2025. There is 25 million golf lessons taken, which is roughly a $2 billion with a B billion industry just in golf lessons. I'm not even talking about apparel and all the other stuff. Just in golf lessons. And the reality is golf lessons don't work if you're senior looking to gain more distance, improve your consistency in ball striking, play more frequently without aches and pains. The reality is golf lessons don't work if you're a senior specifically trying to gain more distance, improve your consistency, or play more frequently without aches and pains. That's just a fact right there. Now, here's the reason why. Give me one second. Let me make sure that This is working. One second, guys. Bear with me. One second. Where we at? Okay, that's good. Okay. And we're back. Sorry about that, guys. So, the reality is golf lessons don't work if you're a senior trying to gain more distance, improve consistency, improve your ball striking, play more frequently without aches and pains. And here's the reason why. Because 99% of golf philosophy, 99% of golf technique revolves around that 25year-old body's ability to move. And and somebody's with the with the athletic ability to perform flawless technique. What happens to the human body? Everybody on here is over the age of 50, more or less. What happens to the human body over the age of 50 is it moves differently. After the age of 60, it moves even more differently. And it's really like this this sharper line, more black and white. Before age 65, after age 65, the body just moves differently. But the problem is we keep trying to use this same golf lesson at 75 that we did at 55 and it doesn't work anymore because the golf lesson is focusing on golf technique, not biomechanics. Biomechanics is how the body moves. So this leads to swinging harder and more erratic, poor consistency of ball flight, poor ball striking, even more distance lost, frustration, and then the worst one is loss of enjoyment of the game. None of this should be groundbreaking. Every one of you is experiencing this in some way, shape, or form. That's why you're on this call right now. The reality is there is a solution. That's why you're here. That's what I'm going to do for us. This is going to be the fun part. This is what I'm so excited for. The solution is Sell your clubs, give up your membership, and play pickle ball. Where's all the smiles at? That was a joke. Come on, guys. Stephen, I'm looking right at you. Give me a smile. Oh my goodness. So, that's not the solution. Or start working smarter not harder. So, what we have to do is first we have to identify What is the true root cause problem that is causing your deteriorating golf game? No. Age is not the primary reason. This is so important. So often when we're losing distance, we have poor consistency, poor ball striking, we want to revert back to saying, "You're getting old." Because that's what everybody says. You're getting old. That's what happens in golf. Well, Reality is I've got a 97y old right now that is kicking ass. There's nothing slowing him down. We just had an hour session yesterday virtually and he is kicking ass at 97 years old. So age is not the problem. What is the problem? Oh, stop freezing on my baby. There we go. Here's what is the problem is muscles versus momentum. I've got some very good visuals coming up next. So this is one of the things I'm adding to this this webinar this time is a visual of what is the difference between when you use muscles to swing the golf club, specifically the driver, versus momentum to swing the driver. The most common words that my clients say after they realize this difference is, "I never felt that before." Or, "Wow, that's what it feels like to fire my core and glutes. Let me explain even further right here with these. Oh, we're not going to do it on this one. We'll do it on the next page. So, the Burman method focuses 100% on biomechanics and not technique. Biomechanics is how your body moves. Specifically, how your muscles control your joints. So, pay attention to this everybody on the call. Biomechanics is how your muscles control your joints. That's how active intentional motion occurs. A muscle contracts that moves that joint. Movement occurs. Motion occurs. So, here we go. The difference between momentum and muscles using the driver. We got Scott here. Scott is a very athletic golfer on the younger side of what you would call a senior. Very athletic on the younger side. On the left, what you see is how he He's on day one. This was his swing on the left. Scott's coming in because we have no consistency of where the ball's going. It's going left, right, straight. Have no idea. When he does get a hold of it, it goes a mile. When he doesn't get a hold of it, it's an embarrassment. So, this is specifically at the transition. Both of these pictures are specifically at the transition of the back swing to the down swing on the the left. This is before we did anything. This is the definition of a momentbased swing. The the lead elbow is bent and the club shaft is pretty much parallel to the ground.
Is that the one you're supposed to be? The one on the right.
The one on the right is what we want to be. Because now look at what we have here. We have a 90° angle between his arm and the club shaft. This is what happen. s when you use m muscles versus momentum. Now look at the differences. They're very subtle. I mean, it looks like the body is relatively turned about the same amount. The difference is the the swing on the right is controlled. The swing on the left is not controlled. That's where you have to see you. Oh, what's happening here? What just happened? Get out of here. I mean, not get out of here. Get in here. Sorry. Okay. So, on the right, we're using core muscles. We're using glute muscles. We're using shoulder muscles to control where the back swing stops. On the left, we're just swinging it as fast as we possibly can. Let me give you a couple more examples here. Oh, sorry. Here's Bruce. Love this guy. Absolutely love him because he is a workhorse. He will go to the driving range for hours. He'll go to the gym for hours doing whatever he possibly can to improve his golf game, his tennis game. It doesn't matter. He just wants to get better. On the left, you see the bend in the elbow. The bend in the elbow is the biggest killer I see. Period. The bend in the elbow, the lead elbow is the biggest killer, period. And Bruce has the club shaft past parallel. Once we start using core muscles and glute muscles, the right way. The club shaft is not even close to parallel anymore and that left elbow is much straighter. And we've got great extension of the hands away from the chest. Everybody pay attention to this. Great extension of his hands away from his chest. The further your hands are away from your chest, the bigger the arc is going to be. The bigger the arc, the faster the club head is going to go. That's how you gain more club head speed. Bruce is a perfect example. On the left, he's got more shoulder turn than he does on the right. But his arc is much bigger on the right than it is on the left. So, by the laws of physics, the club head on the right is going to swing faster than it will on the left. Here's another example. Here's John. Oh, I got these switched up on you. Sorry, guys. Pre-treatment is on the right this time. So, before we did anything, this is John on the right. Club shaft is past parallel. This is the most common thing I see. I know that at least 25% of you on this call right now are saying, "I don't look like that." I'm telling you, you do. At least 50% of the people that I see on day one, closer to 75, you're getting that club shaft past parallel and you have no idea that you're doing it. On the left, this is what happens when John engages his core and his glutes. We can see that his left shoulder is a little bit weaker than uh Scots was in the first picture, which is why his elbow still bent a little bit, but still look at the shaft. It doesn't even come close to parallel anymore. The most important part is look at the distance his hands are maintaining away from his chest.
January
versus is on the right. His hands are pretty much hugging his head. There's no arc on the right. He may be able to swing it faster with his arms, but he's not moving the club head faster. Let me say that again. The swing on the right, the picture on the right feels feels like you can swing the club faster because you're using your arms and your wrists. But the reality is the swing on the left, the club club head is moving faster regardless of what your feel is. Here's a great one right here. So, this is a side view of what happens when you bend that left elbow. I'm sorry, your lead elbow. Again, when you bend the lead elbow, you straighten Let me get this out of here. There we go. When you bend your lead elbow, look at the picture on the right, everybody. The picture on the left is how bent his knee is in the address position. Then on the right, look how straight the knee is at the top of the back swing. There is 0% chance that his right glute is working right here. It's biomechanically borderline impossible for the glute to fire when the right knee is straight in this trip planer rotation. motion. Now, those were some complicated words just for me to tell you that from a biomechanic standpoint, remember that's me. That's who I am. I'm a biomechanics expert. I'm a doctor of physical therapy, which means my doctorate degree is in biomechanics. When you're in this trip planer motion, that's what the golf swing is. It's it's a motion in three different planes, it's almost impossible for you to fire your your glutes and your right leg when that Right knee straightens at the top of the back swing. The right knee straightens, the lead elbow bends, you get this little whippy action, and then you just hope and pray that you make contact with the golf ball. Okay, let me get out of here real quick. Stop sharing this. Let me come back to here. There we go. Okay. So, that's where we all are starting. Everybody on this call is guilty of that in some way, shape, or form because that's been my marketing message for years now is specifically for senior golfers struggling with all these things. The most important thing that I want everybody to take away from this is how do you change it? How do you go from using a momentbased swing to a muscle-based swing? All four of those pictures are black and white explicit examples of how everybody starts off with a momentumbased swing, flippy, windy, whack, wrapping it around your neck to a musclebased swing. And 100% of the people that can do that, distance is the result. 100% of the people that can use their core and their glutes to control the back swing swing and reverse it into the down swing, gain more distance. 100% of the people that I work with are seniors. That's the most important part that I want everybody to take away from this is you don't have to swing faster, you need to swing smarter. So, this next part of this this slideshow, we're going to go through real quick. We're going to go through real quick. We're not going to spend too much time on it, and I'm going to tell you why here in a about 15 seconds. We're going to go through exactly how to do it. Exactly how you go from using momentum to swing the golf club to using muscles to swing the golf club. Now, the reason why I'm not going to spend so much time going through this next part of the slideshow is because that's what we're going to do for the next four weeks. So, at the end of this thing, what I'm going to ask for ask you guys to do is I want you guys to join me on a four-week challenge. We're going to meet every single week for the next four weeks on a group Zoom call. And over the next four weeks, what we're going to focus on is we're going to focus on increasing flexibility, increasing power from your core and your glutes, putting that into the golf swing so that we can have a controlled, safe golf swing, and then ultimately gain 10 more yards in 30 days. That's what we're going to do at the end of this. So, Pay attention to this next part. This is how we're going to do it. Let's go back to sharing. View slideshow. Game on. Stephen, you're my eyes again. You can see my slideshow again. Thumbs up.
Yeah, we're good. Okay. So, here we go. This is the seven state step sevenst step framework. Sevenstep framework on how we're going to increase our strength and stability and swing the club more efficiently. Step number one is in the address position. You can take notes on this, but again, this is what we're going to be doing for the next four weeks. So, you don't really need to take notes on this. This is exactly what we're going to be going through. In the address position, you've always got to check your gas, grip, alignment, stance. Nothing else matters more. if your grip is not correct. I got all this straight from John Rom when John Rom was defending his uh master's title. He was on a podcast I listened to and super long story short, the interviewer asked John Rom, "What's one piece of advice you have to give to us for amateur golfers?" And he goes, he just starts laughing and he says, "They just need to spend more time on the basic fundamentals before they ever swing. I mean, check your grip, check your ball placement, check your alignment. it. You know, amateur golfers are in such a hurry to get up there and hit the ball. Check your grip. When's the last time you went to a golf coach, not Jake, I'm not a golf coach, but went to an actual pro to check your grip alignment. This is the big one that drives me nuts. One of my most popular videos on YouTube over the past 12 months is my video where I'm calling out the golf pros for telling senior golfers to close your stance. That means if you're a right-handed golfer, that trail leg, your right leg pros are telling you to drop that right leg back so that you can get a bigger back swing. It drives me freaking nuts. Absolutely nuts. And the reason why it drives me nuts is because that is a compensation. When you close your stance, when you drop that that trail foot back and you close your stance, just to get a bigger back swing. That's a compensation. Yeah, you got a bigger back swing, but you didn't do anything to increase the total available range of motion of your golf swing. So, you got a bigger back swing and then a smaller swing through. So, now you do the whole flipperoo. It's like, what the hell is that? Posture. Your posture in the address position. So many senior golfers are guilty of addressing the ball by rounding down to the golf ball versus maintaining a tall posture and hinging from your hips to get down to the golf ball. Then the easiest thing, the lowest hanging fruit for the vast majority of amateur golfers, myself included, is before you even start to swing, activate your core and your glutes. That will make way more sense here in a little it. So before you even swing, turn your core and your glutes on. Number two, halfway through the back swing. Again, this is the sevenst step framework. So there's going to be seven steps. This is the sevenstep framework on how a senior golfer can move more efficiently to gain more distance. So halfway through the back swing, here's what most senior golfers are guilty of halfway through the back swing, you've already hinged your wrists and the club head is head height. Halfway through the back swing, what we want to see, Can I move this? There we go. There we go. Halfway through the back swing, what we want to see is belt buckle, hands, and club head all in in straight alignment. Belt buckle, hands, club head all in exact alignment. So, you're staying connected. Staying connected. One of these popular terms in the golf world is disconnect, right? Oh, you're not connected. You're disconnected. Connect. Disconnect. Connect. Disconnect. What the hell does all that mean? Let's make it even simple. Moving harmoniously or synonymously moving at the same exact time. Belt buckle, hands, club head all in perfect alignment halfway through the back swing. Number three, top of the back swing. This is where everybody goes wrong. 100% of the people that I've worked with over the past 10ish years, probably closer to 15 years, 100% of the people that I've worked with over that time frame get this part wrong. The reason why is because us male golfers specifically, we're in such a hurry to hit the damn ball. Such a such a hurry to get down in such a hurry to get down there and whack the damn thing. So, we completely skip over what should be happening to transition us from going back this direction to going back the other direction. Think about that for a minute. The difference between a good golf shot and a bad golf shot is usually an eighth of an inch. The difference between a good bad a good golf shot and a bad golf shot is usually an eighth of an inch. And that's either thick, thin, towy, healy, but it's usually about an eighth of an inch. That's the difference between a good shot and a bad shot. When you hit it good, it's like, wow. When you hit it bad, chunk the crap out of it. It went 10 feet. But that's usually the result of an eighth of an inch. Like it's so small. So when we're swinging the club as fast as we can, 70, 80, 90 miles an hour, and we don't control, look at my head. Can everybody see me on the screen down in the bottom? Watch my head. If we don't control the transition of the back swing to the down swing, look at how much my head is moving right here. You can see it going side to side. side to side, side to side. What the hell chance do we have to not get down to the same exact spot every single time if my head is moving this much and I'm swinging the club 80 90 miles an hour? But if we can get to the top of the back swing here, what I'm doing right now, the only thing that I'm doing differently right now is I'm activating my core, my glutes like crazy right now. And you can see that my head's not sliding anymore. Now, I'm going to let my core go. I didn't change anything with my rotation. I just let my core go. Look at how much my head moves again. Core is firing. Head's not moving. This is the most important part. So, over the next four weeks, everybody that joins my challenge, this is going to be where we spend a lot of time and focus is how do we consistently get to the same place at the top? of the back swing and then oh I just talked about your head sliding and then initiate the down swing. So how do we consistently get to the same place at the top of the back swing without the head sliding and then did we initiate the down swing correctly?
When we initiate
William Mayor. Hey William Mayor my mute yourself real quick. There you go. You're muted now. So, when we get to the top of the back swing and we start to initiate the down swing, most of us are guilty of this right here. Hands coming trying to whack the damn ball with the golf golf club. But what we should be doing is the hips start to rotate. The hips initiate the motion down our hands. barely ever even move. The hips initiate the motion. And here's what results from it. The club naturally shallows. The club naturally shallows. When you initiate the down swing with your hips, the club will naturally shallow versus so many of us are trying to manipulate the club so we can have that inside out club path. You should not try to do an inside out club path if you're on this call like with your hands. Sorry, I shouldn't have said that. You should not try to force an inside out club path with your hands if you're on this call. You leave that for the pros on TV. That's a technical thing. Being able to hit a fade versus a draw versus a cut. Who was it? Oh my gosh. I think it was Oh, I'm spacing on the name right now. But I just saw this YouTube clip of being able to hit 10 different shots with the same seven iron. One of the pros was just demonstrating it. Oh man, I can't believe I can't think of this right now. Just two weeks ago, this was at least going viral on my social media where he hit 10 different shots with the same seven iron. And I'm just going, we're not playing the same game. There's a reason why he plays on Sundays for millions of dollars and there's a reason why I don't. Right? It's not you don't do that. So, as a senior golfer, the way that you can shallow the club shaft is with biomechanics, not with technique. You're going to shallow the club club shaft by getting your body getting your body body to initiate. So the club shaft shallows naturally and then the hands just follow. Then the hands just follow. I'm saying it like it's super easy. It's not. It is simple though. Number five, impact position. Key points is the belt buckle still rotating. So this one we're going to spend a little bit of time on this one because so many of us think so many of us think that we're compressing the golf ball with our irons. So many of us think that our belt buckle is leading the way through impact. I was guilty of this for about three and a half months where before I got fitted for a whole bag, a whole set of irons, I wanted to improve my swing and I really wanted to improve compressing the golf ball because I was getting fit for irons. I didn't want to spend five grand on irons. just to improve my swing later. And then those irons weren't relevant anymore. So, I spent just over three months really trying to improve my biomechanics and hitting down on the golf ball. And here's what I did. I would take my phone and put it on slow motion video across the golf ball from me so that it could catch what my body looked like at the impact position. And I kid you not, 100% of the time that I thought 100% of the time that I thought that I was lagging the golf club and my belt buckle was leading the way. I would go and I'd be so excited and I'd get to the the video and I'd scroll to the impact position. I'm going, "What the hell?" My belt buckle, belt buckle, hands, and club head were all in perfect alignment at impact. There was no forward press that I was not forward pressing at all. And I'm going, "What the hell?" It f felt it felt like I was and I'm going this what is happening right now. That's when I learned how you have to train your brain to do it completely different. So now I know how to do it. Now I know how to get seniors to do it. So Michael Litwin, he's going to be one of my success stories here in a couple of slides. He's 77 years old and he lags the golf club. I get or the club head, sorry. He lags it at 77. And it's like it's amazing. It's physically po. He's not the only one. He's just one of the stars right now. Gained 50 yards. So, I'm going to blow him up right now. So, being able to hit the golf ball first and the ground second for irons is one of the best ways to prove to yourself that you are compressing the golf ball and you're improving your ball striking. It's very rare that you see a senior golfer take a divot after the golf ball. Usually, it's before the golf ball and you're going, "Oh my gosh, what the hell just happened?" Keep your head down. Proper weight shift. Being able to properly go from the address position where you're 50/50, 50% of your weight's on the right leg, 50% of your weights on the left leg to the top of the back swing where you're loading minimum of 80% of your weight through the right leg or trail leg. So there's only 20% or less on the left leg or the lead leg and then being able to push that weight onto the lead leg. Being able to push it over there. So now we've got 80% on the lead leg, 20% on the trail leg is one of the lowest hanging fruits for senior golfers. And pay attention to this is a blue light special. The number one reason Why seniors cannot do a proper weight shift onto that left side is not because of flexibility. It's not because of weakness. It's not because of athleticism. It's because of proprioception. Proprioception is a fancy way of saying balance. It's because your brain doesn't trust that you can balance your weight on that. left leg. So, the way that you test it is
don't scared right now, but just stand on your left leg. If you can stand on your left leg for a minimum of 20 seconds without flailing around, then you are physically able to get your weight onto that lead leg in the swing through. We'll talk way more about that over the next four weeks. So, release after impact. This is where we want to release at right center field. I know a lot of you have heard that. I know that that really messes with me. I don't really know what that means because we're playing golf. We're not playing baseball. Like conceptually, I I get what you're saying. Release it like you're swinging out to right center. And I'm like, yeah, but we're playing golf and the targets over there. So, that didn't really that doesn't really help me. So, what does help me is knowing that your arms are fully extended. You can only see one arm right now on my screen, right? There's two of them there. but you can only see one of them. So, knowing that your arms are fully extended right after the golf ball's gone is how you know that you have hit the golf ball with your body and not your arms. If you go to the bottom one, no chicken wings, here's what you would see is that left elbow, that lead elbow starts to chicken wing and you pick the the club handle up. That's the one where you're finishing up here versus swinging around the body. body. When you chicken wing, that's where you finish up here versus swinging around the body. When we can achieve this, the club releases naturally. There's no forced movement. We don't have to try to hit down on the golf ball. We don't have to try to compress it because your body's moving the way that it should be moving. Then number seven, this is the the best one. I love this one because lowhanging fruit, absolute lowhanging fruit. You want to get your chest and your belt buckle to face the target. There should be minimal pressure on that trail foot. Less than 10%. So little pressure on that trail foot that you should be able to pick that trail foot up and down, up and down, up and down off the ground without having to do this. So, I'm picking up my trail foot right now, but because there's too much weight on it, I have to shift back and forth. But if I get all my weight onto that lead leg, I'm picking it up, up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down, and my body doesn't move. This is huge lowhanging fruit for senior golfers. And this is what we're going to end our four-week challenge with is when we start to put it all together, okay, let's get to that finish position. So, There is our sevenstep framework. What's next? Introducing the 10 yards and 30day challenge. I hope you guys are excited about this cuz I'm really freaking excited about this. This is what we're going to go over in the next four weeks if you choose to join this thing. Week one, we're going to increase flexibility. The first thing that we have to do is we have to increase shoulder turn naturally. Right? So, this might sound counter intuitive if you were at the beginning of the call. At the beginning of the call, what I was referring to when people are trying to increase shoulder turn, you're trying to force it. Like you're really trying to force it. What we're going to do here is we're going to increase shoulder turn by increasing thoracic mobility, increasing the flexibility of the middle of your spine. When you do that, shoulder turn increases naturally from a biomechanics standpoint. You don't have to force it and really get the damn thing back and do this reverse pivot thing. Week number two, that's the fun week. We're going to focus on generating more power from our core and our glutes. Little teaser. One of the ways that we're going to do it is we're going to focus on the intrinsic muscles in your foot. The intrinsic muscles. in your foot. So, this is a little teaser. You've got 16 muscles in the arch of your foot. Allan, I hope you're paying attention to this. I can't see you on my screen right now, but I'm talking to you right now. 16 muscles in the arch of your foot. It's four layers of four muscles. Four layers of four muscles in the arch of your foot. These 16 muscles are crucial, absolutely crucial to telling your brain that your foot is grounded. When your brain knows that your foot is grounded, it will allow you to activate your glutes way more easily. Now, think about this. I know there's a lot of people from up north right now on this call. If you were walking across ice, do you walk like fluidly like, "Hey, what's going on?" Would you just run around and jump around? or do you walk very very rigidly trying to be as stiff as you possibly can because you don't want to slip. The answer is you walk rigid and you don't want to slip when you're walking on ice because your feet are not grounded. The same thing is true in the golf swing when you're walking on ice because your feet are not grounded and they're slippery. They're slipping. and sliding. Your brain knows that you cannot activate the other muscles the way that you could because there your feet are not grounded. So when those 16 muscles in the arch of your foot work the way that they should, it tells in the golf swing, we're back to the golf swing now. It tells your brain it's safe. It's safe over there. So it allows your core and your glutes boots to do what they should be doing and it takes all the stress off of your back and it allows your true shoulder turn to come from your thoracic spine. It allows you to maintain extension of your hands away from your chest during the entirety of the back swing and then more importantly allows you to reverse the back swing to the down swing and hit the damn white little white thing. So there's a little teaser on power. Week number three we're going to apply the increased flexibility and power towards the ball swing in slow motion. This is usually the hardest part for my male golfers is just because we learn how to do it doesn't mean we're going to go out and hit golf balls. We must be able to perform the golf swing as close to correct as close to perfect as possible using the right muscles at the right time. So week three is going to be focused entirely on putting it all together in slow motion. Then week four is when we start to have fun. All right, let's put this thing together. Let's gain the 10 yards. So, that's what we're going to be doing over the next four weeks. Oh, what do we got here? Here's our Oh, here's Michael Litwin. Bottom right. How do I get rid of this? There we go. So, bottom right is Michael Litwin. He's 77 years old and He can compress the golf ball like no other. All of these videos are test real testimonials. All the video testimonials are on my YouTube page, so go check them out. Enzo, I think you're on the call. I think I saw this. Didn't I see your name pop up? Enzo, aren't you on here? So, Enzo did amazing. Gained 97 total yards on a par five. That came out to 38 yards on the driver, 41 yards with a seven iron, 18 yards with a wedge. Enzo, if you're on this call, unmute at sometime at some point because I want to hear from you. I haven't seen you in a little bit. So, that's huge right there. 97 total yards on a par five. Tell me you can't have more fun when you do that. Here's Peter. Peter, 78 years old. By the time we did this, this was four or five years ago, so I think he's 82 now, but he gained 41 yards off the drive and shaved shaved six strokes. So, he's at There's Paul over here still loving life, still still whacking it around, playing in the tournaments. The biggest take-home message for Peter was activating the core. So, being able to activate the core specifically at the transition of the back swing to the down swing was the big game changer for Peter. Uh, here's a bunch of other names. So, Richard, 69 years old, shaved three club lengths from Tet to Green, 13 yards with the driver, 19 yards with a seven iron. So that's three to total club lengths from Tet to Green. John, that was one of the first uh that was the second picture I showed you earlier. So John, he plays at an executive course. So we were working on consistency. So he improved his consistency with his seven iron by 64%. What that means is when you improve your consistency, your dispersion comes down. So Everybody look at my face on the screen down here at the bottom. When we improve consistency, if you're hitting a seven iron, you're trying to hit a green, a ball's going to go over here, ball's going to go over here, over here, over here. It's not consistent. But when we improve it by 64%, you tighten that bunch up big time. And he gained 13 more yards with a seven iron. Michael Hines, he is actually one of the videos that's getting the most views right now on my YouTube page. but is the oldest. So, it's it was actually posted about a year ago today. He is the thumbnail. This is Michael Hines, 72 years old, shaved six strokes off his index, and is now actually proud of his game. So, this was a big one. I can't tell you how many times I have a potential client talk to me on the phone and say, you know, I don't really care so much about distance or consistency as much as I don't even enjoy this game anymore. I'm not proud of it. I get to the set the 19th hole and it's like what the hell? That that was that was an embarrassment of a round. So being able to get to that 19th hole and actually feeling good about your game, proud of your game, that's a big one. So here we go. 10 yards in 30 days. It is a fourw week body friendly distance system designed specifically for senior golfers. No. gimmicks, no strain on the joints, just smart body friendly techniques designed specifically for golfers who earn their stripes. No swinging harder, no stress on the joints, no guesswork, 100% built on biomchanics special offer. Who thinks that I'm going to say 10 grand for this? Everybody raise your hand. Bill, I'm looking right at you right now. 10 grand for this.
Sure. Sure. Why not?
It's worth every bit.
Oh my gosh, you're cracking me up. I can't wait to see you again here, Bill. Glad your back's feeling better.
Thank you.
Okay, 97 bucks. 97 entire for this four-week program. Why in the world would I ever do this for $97? That's just insane. So, for a limited time, you can save $400 on the four live weekly Zoom sessions with me. That's normally $4.97 to do this program, but we're going to do it for $97 today. And here's the reasons why here in a minute. But wait, there's more. Here's all the added bonus. This is what I really want you guys to get. So, I I like the idea of the four weekly Zoom calls, but more importantly, I wanted to use this as a vehicle because of these bonuses here. You're going to get lifetime access to this recordings, private community access, weekly workout videos. But here's a big one is if you guys if you invite a buddy to come join this four-week challenge with us, I'm going to give you a one-on-one session with me for free valued at $397. Because here's what I want to do. I want to be able to tell the world this is what we just did with senior golfers in 30 days. So, This is This is mainly for me for like being able to have bragging rights. That's why I'm doing this for $97 is because I know this is going to work. I just know it. I've done it. This is the same thing that I've been doing for years. We're just doing this in a group setting this time. And I want to be able to scream it from the mountaintops that golf lessons don't work. If you're a senior golfer and you're going to a golf lesson to gain distance, to improve consistency, to improve ball striking. They don't work because the golf lesson is focused on technique, not biomechanics. So, what we are going to do over these next four weeks is we're going to focus 100% on biomechanics, working smarter, not harder, working smarter, not harder. And we're going to gain a minimum of 10 more yards with the big dog 30 days from today. So, all of this added bonus. Pay attention to this because this is real. All the added bonus comes out to 1,200 bucks. $1,285. You're going to get all that free. Just pay the $97. That's pretty much just saving your seat so that we can do these group zoom Zoom calls and let's freaking gain the distance. This is going to be a big one. So, I'm going to open this thing up to Q&A here in a second, but before I do that, I am going to drop this thing. Come on. Let's go. Here we go. All right. So, I'm going to drop this link in the chat. I want you to go ahead and click on this link and get signed up because I want to know how many people we're going to do for this thing because we're going to start with some immediately actionable things here in a second. There we go. All right. I just dropped it in the chat. So, go ahead, Tommy Fleetwood. Who typed that? David. Thank you, David. That was insane. So, what David's talking about was that video that I was referring to earlier, which was Tommy Fleetwood hit 10 different shots with a seven iron. And I'm just going, we can't why do we even think that we're even remotely close to the same world as these people. We're not We're not even close. 10 different shots with the same seven iron. It's just insane. Uh, next question from David. Why weight shift at all? Why not keep the weight on the front leg the whole time? I love this question. This is like the stack and tilt method. Why not keep the weight on the front leg the whole entire time? It's very similar, if not identical, to the theory behind the stack and tilt. If you're trying to gain distance, it will never work. If you're just trying to improve ball striking and get the the ball to go straight, it's the best thing that you could do. And for complete transparency, I don't play a lot of golf right now in this season of life. I've got three kids, 52 and one, trying to run multiple business here. We're in snowbird season right now, so we're cranking. I I don't play a lot of golf right now. When I do get to go out and play with like Bill or Michael or any of my clients where it's time to go out and implement this on the course, it's not uncommon for my game to be a little sporadic. So, one of my go-tos is I will do 80% of my weight on the front leg and keep it there. I'll even drop my trail foot back behind me so that I'm swinging entirely on that front leg. And what it does is it immediately improves my consistency in ball striking and it goes straight down the middle 99% of the time, but it doesn't go anywhere as far as distance goes. As far as distance goes, I lose 20% minimum 20% minimum when I do that um when I don't shift the weight. So, great question, David. Really love it. Here we go. What's next? What is more important, distance or accuracy, David?
Distance.
Oh my gosh. I think the obvious answer is accuracy because you should have multiple clubs to give you the more distance. But here's the rebuttal or here's the devil's advocate when we're talking about seniors. If you don't have enough distance off the tea, then you usually don't have enough long clubs in the back. tag to get there. So, it's this balance, right? You got to have distance. You got to have consistency. And here's the best part about it is everybody pay attention to this. This is a fun thing that has been true 100% of the time, especially over the past four years that I've really refined the Burman method is on day one before we do anything, I always force my client to answer this question. If I could only give you one, which one would it be? more distance or better accuracy. Consistency ball striking. It's all the same thing, right? More distance, better consistency. And everybody always says the same thing. Well, I really would like both. I say, "No, you have to give me one or the other." And they choose distance or they choose consistency. And I say, "All right, great. Here's the good news. They're both going to happen anyways because distance, gaining distance as a senior is the result of using more muscles in the golf swing to generate more power to deliver that power into the golf ball. Consistency occurs when you use muscles to control the golf swing. Remember 30 minutes ago or so when I was I was doing this head slide thing. So when I'm not using my core and I'm going to the top of the back swing, and transitioning to the down swing. This is an exaggeration, right? Just an exaggeration so you can see it on camera. But imagine if it was a half of an inch. A half of an inch and I told you the dis the difference between a good shot and a bad shot is an eighth of an inch. Well, if my head slides a half of an inch at the transition of the back swing to the down swing, my accuracy, my consistency is just a crapshoot. It's going to rely on my hand eye coordination, my ability ility to be an athlete and deliver the club head down to the golf ball. Problem is, the older you get, the body moves differently, that athletic ability starts to decline because the body starts to decline. So, great question. Great, great question, Jerry. Please review what I will receive for the $97. You'll receive a certificate saying from my 5-year-old. Thank you so much for contributing to my college fund. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. Uh Jerry, what we're doing for the $97 is you're going to get all of those bonuses that I had. I can pull that screen up here in a little bit. But more importantly, you're going to get access to this group. We're all going to do this as a group. We're going to do the next four weeks group Zoom sessions every Wednesday. We're going to do it. If you can't make the call, on Wednesday. You got to sign up anyway. It's going I'm going to send out the replay the very next day. So, it's going to be four weeks of live coaching. We're doing this all we're doing this in real time. Then you're going to keep the recordings of all this. You're going to get group access or you're going to get access to the community. I'll introduce you. Let me do that real quick. Actually, I'll do that here in a second. But I'll show you what our community is. It's in school SK O L. It's kind of similar to to Facebook, but it's mainly for coaching programs. Uh, what else? David, you're on a fire. You're on fire right now. Keep these questions coming. What is an acceptable driver distance for a senior? That is the million-dollar question. I've got some people that are happy if they could hit it 140 yards. Because the definition of a senior is what? 60, 50, 70. I've got some people that don't think they're seniors and they're 75. So, it really depends. deps on who you are, what is your physical ability, what's your height and weight. Like, we don't want to be unrealistic. If you're 5'8 and 140 lbs, 80 years old, and you're telling me you want to hit it 250 yards, okay, well, the laws of physics and reality are telling us that it's probably not realistic in general. In general, If you're physically able, meaning that your body moves well and you've got some decent physical ability, like you can get down on the ground, you can get back up again. Think about that. You can get down on the ground and you can get back up again. There's some people on this call that say, "Yeah, that's a joke." But there's other people on the call that say, "Oh, I don't know about that one." without using your hands. Sorry. Get down on the ground and back up again without using your hands. If you're physically able, there's no reason why seniors should not be able to hit it 200 yards. shouldn't. There's no reason. My all-time record right now, Jim, he's one of the first video testimonials that we have on the website. I didn't even have the the golf room didn't even exist. This was back when I was a physical therapist playing with golf performance. He was my by far my he's still my record holder. He gained 65 yards at 65 years old. He gained 65 yards. He was averaging 220 yards and went up to 285. So, I mean like I don't know what the answer is. What do you think of the mini driver? I think the mini driver is great to have another tool. What time are the live group sessions going to be? They're going to be Wednesdays at 3:30. Wednesdays at 3:30. Who's got other questions? Keep the questions coming. David, you're filling up. This is great. Keep the questions coming. You're my star. Shoot it right now. Antonio, you've been sitting there staring. Come on. You got to have something. Let's go. Give me something. Bill, you're good. Am I going to see you here soon?
Let's hope so. Can you hear me?
Yeah, I can hear you.
Good. Okay, we can talk. No problem.
Yeah. Okay.
I I'll just inter I'll interject. Um, for less than $25 of time, you know, I think it's worth any everybody's time to try it. I mean, I think he you're going to get four hours of instruction. You'll learn something for sure. Okay? I've done this portion. Okay? And you you'll learn something for sure. It' be the best hundred bucks you spent.
Holy cow. I I should be paying you, Bill. I I didn't even think
That's okay. I accept. I accept.
I didn't even think to break it down like that. For less than $25 a week, there's 0% chance that you don't get a return on investment. I mean, I I mean,
you you'll learn. You you'll get the 10 yards.
Thank you, Bill. That was
I came in late, too. I came in late. Yeah.
Love it. Absolutely love it. Daniel, you're sitting over there in the corner. Come on. You look like you're up in the freezing cold somewhere. Where you at?
Sorry. What What What is your question? You look like you're in the freezing cold. Are you in France?
No,
no, no, I'm okay.
What part of the world are you in?
Uh uh Quebec.
Nice. Very nice. So, it is cold up there.
Uh today, no. It's around zero, but uh uh weather is supposed to come back uh tomorrow. And uh tomorrow and Friday around 910. I just want to say also to complete the guy who speak just before I follow um you know just a one hour um course you know
Justin Waters
one hour
oh one hour yeah
and it cost me $100 you know, $100 for four week for one hour per per week. I think I have nothing to critic about that. You you know uh we forget too often uh about uh we just think about the technique but we I think we forget the most valuable thing is what you try to to tell us about muscle and joint and all I I I start to apply a little bit and uh it's sure it's uh is bring me just positive thing about you know my spine and my low back uh uh if I have you know if I have pain or what but since I start to to apply what you said on your book uh is just bring me a positive thing.
Okay,
good.
Love it. Absolutely love it. Daniel, thank you for sharing that. So, what I heard you say was your back was bothering you and then all of a sudden you applied what you found in the book and now your back is feeling better. So, that's a good thing.
Exactly. Exactly.
Yeah. Love it. Very cool. Thank you for sharing that, Daniel. I really appreciate it. So, to go back to Ken, let me answer you real quick. Do we have access to your whole library? past the four weeks. Lifetime access, baby. Lifetime. Like, this is this is insane. Like, it's really crazy. But this is how much it means to me. I mean, this stuff works. And I want to be able to scream from the mountaintops that you have to start using your body the right way. And look at all the people that have done it. I mean, I've already got countless names on the wall. Everybody that's been watching my videos, you see the wall of fame in there. You see all the people that have gained the distance and improved in the brick and mortar. Now I'm trying to build the same thing. The reputation, the consistency, the proof digitally. I know this works. Bill hit the nail on the head. There's no way you don't get at least $25 worth of value every single week. So, you'd be a fool, an absolute fool to not spend $97 and gain for the chance at gaining 10 more yards over the next 30 days. Oh, by the way, I didn't even say this. 100% satisfaction guarantee. So, if we get through the end of this thing and you're like, Jake, this was complete b*******, a waste of my time. Guess what? I won't even refund you the $97 on your card. I'll put a freaking $100 bill in the mail and mail it back to you and say dinner on me. Like, it it would just be insane to think that you don't get a $100 worth of value in this thing. So, great question, Ken. I really appreciate it. Uh, Martin, don't you have to move left before rotating hips to begin down swing? Great question. We'll talk all about it over the next four weeks. In short, what I like to think of, it's called a bump and turn. Bump and turn. So, there's a difference between sliding left and bumping the hips. Bumping the hips left. We'll talk way more about this in week three as we go through this. But yes, you're correct. Uh, great information, but I need to drop. I have to go. We'll think about it. There's nothing to think about, Dave. What the heck? Are you kidding me? Oh, he said that he's in the office around this time. Doesn't matter. We're not going to be hitting golf balls. We're not hitting golf balls live on the call. We're working 100% on getting the right muscles working at the right time. Uh, Antonio, take the opportunity. We got one. We got one that's going to do it. No, I'm getting dinged over here. I've actually got quite a few people that are that have already signed up. So, that's exciting. Uh, who else? What else? What other questions do you have? Because I got Allan that just joined the call again. Allan, we're going to do a a live workup real quick, aren't we?
Uh, yes, sir. Yep. Yep. Yep. Definitely. Thank you.
Okay. Okay. So, if anybody if nobody else has a question, Allan is one of my guys that went through a program that we did over the summer, which we're focusing on biomechanics. It was the T-shot transformation where we did it all live. Bill, you were part of that for most of the classes. Um Allan went through it and we got some really good you, not we, you got some really good results.
So, what I wanted or what I wanted to do with real quick was I wanted to go through a quick reassess if that's okay with everybody else on the call. Feel free to jump off if you need to. You can watch the recording, but Allan, go ahead. I want to see where we're at. Are we going to be able to do this in this in this area here?
Yeah, probably. I can't uh I can't do a uh full swing by any means or I, you know, have to choke up a little bit or I hit this hit the ceiling. But uh but yes, like I think I mentioned, I was still having uh some back pain. So, I wanted to see if you could uh do a quick evaluation and see uh why I might be having some back pain still after, you know, I'd say consecutive days of golf. You know, once in a while I'm fine, but if I do it back to back or, you know, three times a week is when I really notice my uh weakness in my back.
Okay. Yeah, let's do it. Go ahead and turn your blur off. You got to turn the blur off so I can see you. And then everybody else, if you're not going to stay and watch what we do with Allan, go back into the chat and click that link. Sign up. Sign up. Sign up. Sign up. Bring a friend. Invite a friend to this four-week challenge and you get a $400 session on me. Antonio, don't you don't need to leave the office. We're going to be doing this. You can do it wherever you want or just watch the replay. You're going to get the same value out of the replay. So, don't worry about that. All right, Alan. Let's see what we got here.
This good. You want me to fix the other way?
That's Let's do this way first.
All right. I'm just going to choke down here so don't uh don't
you can choke way down as far as you need to. Like you can go even more than that if you need to.
Yeah, that's fine. All right, cool. So, you know, coming back. I have pressure here. Come down. Okay, let's do it again. Love this. This is so good for everybody that's still on this call. Do Do it again. All right. Now, stay right here, Allan. Everybody watch Allen's head in relation to the books behind him. Love it. Do it again, please, sir. Everybody watch. Look at the books behind them. Oh, damn it. It switched over.
That move.
Yes. Well, that's that was the best one you did right there.
Do it again. That's so much better. Do you feel what you're doing differently now?
Yeah. I mean, I think that the more pressure I'm putting on my right uh right glue right glute um is kind of, you know, what what the goal is, right?
This is perfect right here. So, prior to me calling you out over and over again, your head was literally sliding 8 in.
Right. Right. Like, you were sliding big time. When you're sliding, that's 100% proof that that glute is not completely optimized. When you're sliding, that's 100% proof that the glute is not completely activated and optimized.
So, this is where we got to get really focused. If I was standing there in the room right now, Bill can attest to this, I would literally start punching you in the gut, saying, "Fire that core. Fire that core." There, that's even better. That's the best one you've done so far.
That one was the best one you did.
How the f*** did you get out of this?
Do you feel the difference?
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. I think it's just still like kind of re-engaging this guy. Uh probably most importantly.
Yeah. So, what you were doing was probably 75% versus what we needed to be, which is 100%.
Right. Right. Okay.
Do you mind if we share a little bit about the foot surgery?
Uh yeah, that's fine. Yeah. So, I had the uh like foot pad injections on my foot. So, uh in the beginning going barefoot was tough for me, but uh I do think like if you do go barefoot, you really feel pressure where you should on your feet. Um and I think that helps. But yeah, no, my my foot's fine now, so I'm good. So, the reason why this is important is because Allan had a intervention on his foot. And I'm going to use the word intervention loosely. Could be surgery. It could be an injection. It could be anything. It's just something happened to Allen's foot. And his brain perceived that something happened there. Because something happened there, it goes into protective mode where your brain puts it in protective mode. And to recover or to let his foot heal from the fat pad injection, he had to not use it for a few weeks. Had to use the the padded shoe. And you were not supposed to push through it very hard, right? Right.
Right. Yep. Yep. Yep. That's exactly right.
That triggers the brain to take it easy on the right compared to the left or I'm sorry on the the glute compared to what it would have done. So now what we just did right there was Allan thought that he was doing everything that he was supposed to be doing with loading his core, loading his glutes, yet his head was still sliding eight inches in the back swing, which means his head's got to slide 16 inches in the down swing. So now we've got all of this happening and all of that goes directly to the back.
Right. Okay. Okay. That's good. That's good. Yeah. Sometimes a little refresher is good.
Not sometimes, all the time.
Exactly.
That's awesome. Thank you for letting us do that live, Alan. I really appreciate that.
Of course. Of course. Of course. Good.
Cool. Anybody else that's still on the call? Any last questions? Let's go ahead and get everybody signed up. This replay is going out tomorrow so that you You can go back and take notes if you want. Uh, let's try to get as many people into this four-week challenge as we can. Get a buddy to sign up. It's $97. Like Bill said, it's less than 25 bucks a week. And the chances that you don't get a return on investment, it's like almost you pretty much have to do nothing. If you do nothing, it's going to be the worst 97 bucks you ever spent. But if at least you hear me, if you at least hear me, it's going to be a better return on investment than watching the golf channel. So, let's get get buddies in here. Everybody that refers a friend, everybody that brings a friend in here, free session on me. Let's do this thing. This is going to be a ton of fun. Who else? Any other questions while before we get out of here? Thomas, Ryan, Martin, I'm good.
